Hey! My name is Maksymilian "Skill" Tym. I'm a hobby game developer in Unity Engine (6-7 years of experience) and more recently Unreal Engine 5 (enrolled in a course to learn it recently). I'm from Poland, I'm 19 years old and I speak pretty fluent Engligh (around B2+/C1) and Polish at a native level of course. If you'd like to know more about the stuff I do, you can visit my GitHub or itch.io pages that are linked on the home page of this website (it's mostly game jams and some small fun projects in Python). For business contact, write an e-mail to skill347.dev@gmail.com (or any other e-mail I provided if you're a recruiter and you already got my CV).
